Warning detected by hpeesofsim during netlist parsing.
    Unrecognizable scale factor `ohm' ignored

SP SP1[1] <FETmodelss_lib:LNA_design+final:schematic>   freq=(5.625 GHz->9.375 GHz)
.Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The simulation temperature (25.0 C) is not the same as the IEEE standard
    noise temperature (290 K or 16.85 C) in the noise analysis `SP1'.
    If the simulation temperature is not equal to the IEEE standard temperature,
    then the loss and the noise figure will not agree for a passive circuit.
    The `Temp' parameter on the Options item can be set to 16.85 C to
    eliminate this warning message.
